# Access Control System using Barcode Reader

This project is a Final Course Project (TCC) developed during high school.  
It implements an access control system that reads student barcodes and checks
whether the student is registered in the system.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system uses a barcode reader to identify students through their ID codes.
After reading the barcode, the application verifies if the student is registered
in the database. If the student is authorized, access is granted; otherwise,
access is denied.

This project was developed using the Pascal programming language, focusing on
logic, data structures, and basic file handling.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Pascal
- Barcode reader
- Text files / local data storage

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The barcode reader scans the student's code.
2. The system receives the code as input.
3. The application searches for the code in the registered students database.
4. If the code is found, access is authorized.
5. If the code is not found, access is denied.
